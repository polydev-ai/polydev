**Assessing polydev perspectives tool usage**

I’m checking if I can run the polydev perspectives tool to answer the user's question about React useEffect infinite loops. It looks like the tool requires a user token, which isn’t available, so I can't run it directly. I’ll need to explain this limitation and suggest the user provide the token or consider alternative ways to get the information.

I can’t run the Polydev “get perspectives” tool without a user token. Please share the Polydev token (from your dashboard) so I can call `mcp__polydev__get_perspectives` and gather the insights on React `useEffect` infinite loops you asked for.
